Instructions and notes:
	- These socks are fitted to 2234083174's Nakao base.
	- These socks are rigged in BDEF4. That kinda makes rerigging a little bit harder unfortunately, but as long as you don't alter it too much, you're all set.
	- The physics are double jointed. If you need to reconfigure the joints at any point, make sure all the joints are plugged in right.
	- You may have to delete some of the mesh below the socks, the mesh still manages to clip through even though I did my best to fit it.
	- A UV map has been provided to help with texturing.
